### Notes

I think I spent the most time working on databinding, the instruction set were not as intuitive as i wanted it to be but I had a great time trying to work around it. I admit, I did get stuck for quite some time on binding the Image using a custom data Binder since it wasnt really clear in the instruction how to make a custom BindingAdapter, then since the instruction were for Picaso and not Glide, i was stuck for abit there too trying to get Glide to work as I wanted it to with the transformation. Overall I had great fun, since the challanging part was what made me mode comfortable (at least a little bit more) with kotlin syntaxes.

One thing I tried to work on was for the YT player to continue where it left of when changing to and fro fullscreen but I wasnt able to, will look forward to learn more about that.

Thank you

## Flix Part 1

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [ ] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [ ] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [ ] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
Im stuggling to use resources.configuration to make an alternative path so that landscape mode displays the backdrop image rather then the poster image. Will try to do so later if time permits
